## 🛠️ Development

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is deployed via [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).

### Prerequisites

The app runs locally in HTTPS so you will need to do the following:

1. Create a Certificate Authority (CA) on your machine
2. Create and add the SSL certificate files to the `./certs` folder

Find out how to do this by Googling the following:
